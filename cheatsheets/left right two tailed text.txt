LEFT TAILED TEST
A left-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis states that the population parameter is less than the hypothesized value.

Example:
A manufacturer claims that the mean weight of a product is at least 50 grams. To test if the mean weight is actually less than 50 grams, you would use a left-tailed test.

RIGHT TAILED TEST
A right-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis states that the population parameter is greater than the hypothesized value.

Example:
A company claims that the average lifespan of their batteries is at least 100 hours. To test if the average lifespan is greater than 100 hours, you would use a right-tailed test.

TWO TAILED TEST
A two-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis states that the population parameter is different from (either less than or greater than) the hypothesized value.

Example:
A study claims that the average IQ score of a group is 100. To test if the actual average IQ score is different from 100, you would use a two-tailed test.
